    <h1>Editor.css</h1>

    <p>
    Editor.css is a lo-fi/retro CSS framework that's intended to look like a text editor or IDE. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I've made it as accessible as possible, but there's only so much that can be done within the
    design constraints. If you decide to use it, I recommend making alternate styles available to 
    consumers as well. To assist with that, editor.css is in the midst of a rewrite to be compatible 
    with <a href="https://picocss.com/">Pico.css</a>. It's a small hobby project though, so I may 
    never finish it!
